# Automated-Plant-Watering-Sytem
This project is about a moisture-sensing automatic plant watering system using C8051F340 microcontroller. 
The system simply senses the moisture level and switches on the irrigation pump when the moisture is below the set limit. 
The system switches off the pump when the moisture rises above the set point. 
The status of the pump (whether ON or OFF) is displayed on a 16Ã—2 LCD display.
